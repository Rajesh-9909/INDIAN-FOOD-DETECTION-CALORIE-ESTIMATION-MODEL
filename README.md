INDIAN FOOD DETECTION & CALORIE ESTIMATION MODEL

Domain:AI Model
Description:The Indian Food Detection & Calorie Estimation Model is a machine learning-based system designed to identify Indian food items from images and estimate their caloric values with high accuracy. Given the rich diversity of Indian cuisine, the project focuses on developing a robust classification model using supervised learning algorithms—primarily convolutional neural networks (CNNs)—trained on a curated dataset containing images of commonly consumed Indian dishes such as biryani, dosa, chapati, paneer dishes, and sweets like gulab jamun and rasgulla.
Once the food item is detected, the system cross-references it with a nutritional database to provide an approximate calorie count based on standard serving sizes. Advanced techniques like image preprocessing, data augmentation, and feature extraction are employed to improve model performance and generalization. The application of this model is highly beneficial in fitness tracking apps, dietary assessment tools, and healthcare systems where accurate and automated nutritional analysis is critical. It empowers users to monitor their eating habits more effectively, particularly in culturally rich food environments like India where traditional diet tracking methods fall short.
